# @smsunarto/bb-plugin-gh-stack

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 186c131: Make the release tag installable. Every import the server bundle pulls in at
  runtime is now a real `dependencies` entry, so `bb plugin install` from a git
  tag resolves it. The previous tags built only inside this workspace, where a
  hoisted `node_modules` supplied what the manifests had left out as devDependencies —
  a fresh checkout of the tag failed the build with `Could not resolve "zod"`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- b3ed493: Require bb 0.38 and take the SDK types from the published `@get-bb/plugin-sdk`
  package. `engines.bb` is now `>=0.38.0 <0.39.0`, so an older bb no longer
  installs these plugins.
  
  Agent Proxy gains a `routingStrategy` setting (`round-robin`, `fill-first`, or
  `weighted-round-robin`) that it writes to the core `config.yaml`. Pick
  `fill-first` to keep several Claude OAuth accounts from rotating away the
  upstream prompt cache.
- 65ececd: Release the runtime, presentation, notification, theme, and thread workflow updates.

/**
 * Where the agent is on the board. The stream carries two signals: the edit
 * that produced each version, and the lease's focus. A new version moves the
 * cursor to what it edited; between versions, a changed focus moves it to
 * what the agent says it is looking at. `seq` counts moves, so two edits to
 * the same target still read as two arrivals. A reader who joins mid-session
 * finds him standing on the last edit, already drawn.
 *
 * Each lease scope has its own cursor: the document's courier follows
 * document edits and the document lease's focus, the Diffs page's follows
 * lens edits and the lenses lease's focus. One stream feeds both.

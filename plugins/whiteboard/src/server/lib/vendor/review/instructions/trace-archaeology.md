# Trace archaeology

Agent-written commits record `Agent-Session: <id>` trailers. Use the `whiteboard trace` CLI to resolve and pull those sessions. Use FFF to find candidate events. Use `whiteboard trace show` for exact evidence.

The `whiteboard trace` commands also work without Whiteboard installed or running.

## Configuration

Before hosted setup, explain: full transcripts go to the chosen origin. Writers can upload and check their own status; only admins can read transcripts.

- Enable only user-authorized repositories and origins. Existing authorization is sufficient unless later revoked, including by `whiteboard trace deny`.
- Check `whiteboard trace status`; `--agent-session <id>` narrows uploads. If authorized, run `whiteboard trace store create` when needed, then `whiteboard trace allow .`. Check status again.
- Without authorization, leave capture off and continue read-only investigation. Trace lookup does not require publication.

FFF setup is human-owned. If FFF is unavailable, report the setup gap. Do not replace or reconfigure it.

Local commit trailers and blame resolution work without trace storage access.
Read commands use the machine's selected trace store. When both an S3/R2
bucket and the hosted store are configured, add `--storage s3|hosted` to
read the other one; it changes nothing about capture or consent.

## Explain code provenance

When asked why code exists, who wrote it, or what decisions produced it:

1. Identify the commits behind the target lines:

   ```sh
   whiteboard trace blame <file> -L <start,end> --json
   ```

   This command identifies the last commit that touched each line. Add `--history` only when the current provenance does not explain the decision:

   ```sh
   whiteboard trace blame <file> -L <start,end> --history --json
   ```

2. Pull each relevant session into the local corpus:

   ```sh
   whiteboard trace pull --agent-session <session-id> --json
   ```

   Read the absolute normalized file paths from the response's `paths` array. Do not derive them from the corpus layout.

3. Use FFF to search the normalized files returned in `paths`.

   Treat each result only as a candidate locator. Each trace file has this shape:

   ```text
   <owner>/<repo>/<session>/main.jsonl
   <owner>/<repo>/<session>/<subagent>.jsonl
   ```

   Ignore physical line 1 because it is trace metadata. For a match on line `<L>`, use event index `<L> - 2`. Use the record's `index` when the excerpt shows it.

4. Inspect each relevant event:

   ```sh
   whiteboard trace show <session-id> --trace <trace> --event <event> --json
   ```

   Pass the trace name from the result, including `main`. Search results are not final evidence.

5. Check the current code before you explain the result. The trace can describe a decision that the author later reversed.

This flow is complete when you inspected the relevant events and checked every historical claim against the current code.

## Research a topic

When asked if an agent has previously solved a problem or handled a topic:

1. Pull the current repository traces:

   ```sh
   whiteboard trace pull --json
   ```

   Add `--main-only` only when subagent work is not relevant.
   Read the absolute normalized file paths from the response's `paths` array.

2. Use FFF to search the normalized files returned in `paths`. Read the session and trace from the result path. Ignore physical line 1. For a match on line `<L>`, use event index `<L> - 2`.

3. Inspect the relevant events:

   ```sh
   whiteboard trace show <session-id> --trace <trace> --event <event> --json
   ```

When the investigation starts from one commit, list its sessions first:

```sh
whiteboard trace list --commit <rev> --json
whiteboard trace pull --commit <rev> --json
```

When no commit anchors the investigation, page through every published session of the hosted store with `--cursor`. This command needs the hosted store; on a machine that selects s3, pass `--storage hosted`.

```sh
whiteboard trace sessions --json
```

Use `whiteboard trace show <session-id>` when the full session timeline helps explain the result.

This flow is complete when you inspected the source events and checked the result against current code.

## Evidence Rules

- Treat traces as historical evidence, not current specifications.
- Prefer `--json` when you parse command output.
- Cite session, trace, and event locators for event evidence.
- Cite commit IDs and source lines for current code evidence.
- Report missing or uncertain provenance. Never invent an explanation.

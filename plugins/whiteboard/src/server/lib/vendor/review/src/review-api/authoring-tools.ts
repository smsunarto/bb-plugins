      'Create a review of saved working files, immutable commits or a GitHub PR. Revisions are resolved on acceptance. Omitted commits base means source at head with no diff; supply the parent to review introduced changes. For a GitHub PR, pullRequestUrl alone is enough: target and title become optional, and the host fetches the PR into a registered checkout of its repository and pins the current PR head and GitHub diff base, titled from the PR. When a review for that PR exists, it is returned instead, reporting whether its head moved and whether another session owns it; update it in place, move its target with review_set_target, or create a separate review with reuseExisting. kind:"scratchpad" names the one scratchpad, which the host creates itself. The result carries review, the review as review_list shows it: its target with resolved commits, origin (its PR), repositoryName and repositoryPath, so no follow-up read is needed before diffing. When Desktop is available the review opens there and the result reports opened, softwareMapEnabled and environmentIssues, as review_open does; set open:false to author in the background without taking over Desktop.',
    set_target:
      "Change the review target, preserving document and component IDs. Returns warnings for source references needing repair. Earlier versions keep their retained source.",
    edit: 'Edit a document component. Common content shapes: section `{"type":"section","title":"…","children":[]}`; prose `{"type":"markdown","markdown":"…"}`. Sections require `children` (not `blocks`); Markdown uses `markdown` (not `text`). To populate a section later, insert content with `edit.parentId` set to its returned ID. Flow diagram: `{"type":"flow_diagram","title":"Flow","nodes":[{"key":"a","label":"Start"},{"key":"b","label":"Finish"}],"edges":[{"from":"a","to":"b"}]}`. Use nodes and edges arrays (not children); at least one node is required, edges may be empty, and edge endpoints name unique node keys. Code peek: `{"type":"code_peek","source":{"file":"src/app.ts","start":{"side":"head","line":10},"end":{"side":"head","line":20}}}`. Call stack diff: `{"type":"call_stack_diff","title":"Request flow","base":[{"label":"Entry","source":{"file":"src/app.ts","start":{"side":"base","line":10},"end":{"side":"base","line":20}}}],"head":[{"label":"Entry","source":{"file":"src/app.ts","start":{"side":"head","line":10},"end":{"side":"head","line":20}}}]}`. Both base and head arrays are required; either may be empty. Each frame requires source; optional key/parentKey express nesting, and parentKey must name an earlier frame on that side. Sequence: `{"type":"sequence","title":"Request","actors":{"a":"Client","b":"Server"},"steps":[{"from":"a","to":"b","label":"Send","explanation":"Client sends a request."}]}`. actors is a key-to-label object; steps reference actor keys and each needs exactly one of source, explanation, or code. Database lens: `{"type":"database_lens","title":"Read items","actors":{"app":"App"},"stores":{"db":{"label":"DB","storage":"relational","collections":{"items":{"label":"Items","fields":{"id":{"label":"ID","dataType":"integer"}}}}}},"useCases":[{"label":"Load","operations":[{"kind":"read","actor":"app","store":"db","collection":"items","label":"Fetch items","source":{"file":"src/app.ts","start":{"side":"head","line":10},"end":{"side":"head","line":20}}}]}]}`. actors, stores, collections, and fields are keyed objects; useCases and operations are arrays. Include at least one store and use case, with at least one operation per use case; each operation requires source and must reference declared keys. Source paths are repository-relative; line numbers are 1-based and inclusive. Replace example paths and lines with verified source ranges. The host assigns short durable IDs; use returned IDs to edit components in place. The result identifies the edited component and, for an insert or replace, its first-level children, so they can be edited without a follow-up read. Accepted edits are saved immediately. Omitted placement appends; on the scratchpad it lands at the top, so insert a multi-block thought bottom-up or chain each block with afterId. null removes an optional field in a patch. While a reader may be watching, write small and often: one paragraph per edit, so the document draws itself as you go. Insert a new diagram whole, with all its nodes and edges or steps; the board traces it in one quick pass. Change a diagram already on the board one unit at a time: insert, update or remove a flow_node, flow_edge or step by ID (parentId names the diagram). Link each added flow_node to a node already drawn, so it arrives attached; a separate flow_edge is only for two nodes that already exist. Removing a flow_node removes its edges.',

Requires the lenses lease: review_activity with scope:"lenses", which another agent can hold while the document lease is held elsewhere. The result identifies the lens and reports uncategorized: changed lines no lens selects yet, grouped by file. Keep adding lenses until it is empty or what remains is deliberate. review_lens_get reads the current lenses and gaps.',
